### the unpractical logger

logging is important, but requires a bit of setup on new projects.  
therefore instead of re-configuring a new logger everytime i start  
something new, i have decided to centralize it in this project  

pros  
0. plug-and-play logging for my projects with my paradigms in place  
1. gives me a sandbox to experiment with logging  
2. has taught me some lessons about project dependencies..  

cons  
0. buggy and incomplete  
1. isn't very good  
2. has taught me some lessons about project dependencies..
